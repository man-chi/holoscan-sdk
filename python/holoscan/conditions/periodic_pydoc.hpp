namespace PeriodicCondition {

PYDOC(PeriodicCondition, R"doc(
Condition class to support periodic execution of operators.
The recess (pause) period indicates the minimum amount of
time that must elapse before the `compute()` method can be executed again.
The recess period can be specified as an integer value in nanoseconds.

For example:  1000 for 1 microsecond 1000000 for 1 millisecond,
and 10000000000 for 1 second.

The recess (pause) period can also be specified as a `datetime.timedelta` object
representing a duration.
(see https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#timedelta-objects)

For example: datetime.timedelta(minutes=1), datetime.timedelta(seconds=1),
datetime.timedelta(milliseconds=1) and datetime.timedelta(microseconds=1).
Supported argument names are: weeks| days | hours | minutes | seconds | millisecons | microseconds
This requires `import datetime`.

Parameters
----------
fragment : holoscan.core.Fragment
    The fragment the condition will be associated with
recess_period : int or datetime.timedelta
    The recess (pause) period value used by the condition.
    If an integer is provided, the units are in nanoseconds.
policy : PeriodicConditionPolicy, optional
    The scheduling policy for handling periodic ticks. One of:

    - CATCH_UP_MISSED_TICKS (default): Attempts to catch up on missed ticks by executing
      multiple ticks in quick succession. With a 100ms period:
      * tick 0 at 0ms   -> next_target = 100ms
      * tick 1 at 250ms -> next_target = 200ms (executes as next_target < current_time)
      * tick 2 at 255ms -> next_target = 300ms (double tick before 300ms)
    - MIN_TIME_BETWEEN_TICKS: Guarantees the recess period will elapse between ticks.
      With a 100ms period:
      * tick 0 at 0ms   -> next_target = 100ms
      * tick 1 at 101ms -> next_target = 201ms
      * tick 2 at 350ms -> next_target = 450ms
    - NO_CATCH_UP_MISSED_TICKS: Skips missed ticks without catch-up. With a 100ms period:
      * tick 0 at 0ms   -> next_target = 100ms
      * tick 1 at 250ms -> next_target = 300ms (single tick, no catch-up)
      * tick 2 at 305ms -> next_target = 400ms

name : str, optional
    The name of the condition.
