/**
 * @brief Condition class to allow an operator to execute when a specified number of messages have
 * arrived, or a specified time interval has elapsed since the first message was created.
 *
 * This condition applies to a specific input port of the operator as determined by setting the
 * "receiver" argument.
 *
 * This condition can also be set via the `Operator::setup` method using `IOSpec::condition` with
 * `ConditionType::kExpiringMessageAvailable`. In that case, the receiver is already known from the
 * port corresponding to the `IOSpec` object, so the "receiver" argument is unnecessary.
 *
 * **Note:** The `max_delay_ns` used by this condition type is relative to the timestamp of the
 * oldest message in the receiver queue. Use of this condition requires that the upstream operator
 * emitted a timestamp for at least one message in the queue. Holoscan Operators do not emit a
 * timestamp by default, but only when it is explicitly requested in the `Operator::emit` call. The
 * built-in operators of the SDK do not currently emit a timestamp, so this condition cannot be
 * easily used with the provided operators. As a potential alternative, please see
 * `MultiMessageAvailableTimeoutCondition` which can be configured to use a single port and a
 * timeout interval without needing a timestamp. A timestamp is not needed in the case of
 * `MultiMessageAvailableTimeoutCondition` because the interval measured is the time since the same
 * operator previously ticked.
 *
 * ==Parameters==
 *
 * - **max_batch_size** (int64_t): The maximum number of messages that can arrive before the
 * operator will be considered READY. The operator can still be considered READY with fewer
 * messages once `max_delay_ns` has elapsed.
 * - **max_delay_ns** (int64_t): The maximum delay to wait from the time of the first message
 * before the operator is considered READY. The units are in nanoseconds. A constructor is also
 * provided which allows setting this via a `std::chrono::duration` instead.
 * - **clock** (std::shared_ptr<holoscan::Clock>): The clock used by the scheduler to define the
 * flow of time. If not provided, a default-constructed `holoscan::RealtimeClock` will be used.
 * - **receiver** (std::string): The receiver whose message queue will be checked. This should be
 * specified by the name of the Operator's input port the condition will apply to. The Holoscan SDK
 * will then automatically replace the port name with the actual receiver object at application run
 * time.
