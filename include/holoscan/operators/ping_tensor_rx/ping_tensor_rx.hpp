 * @brief Simple tensor receive operator.

 * This is an example of a native operator with one input port.

 * This operator is intended for use in test cases and example applications.
 *
 * On each tick, it receives a TensorMap and loops over each tensor in the map. For each, it will
 * print the tensor's name and shape.
 *
 * ==Named Inputs==
 *
 * - **in** : nvidia::gxf::Tensor(s)
 *   - One or more received tensors (i.e. a TensorMap).
